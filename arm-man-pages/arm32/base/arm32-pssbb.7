 Physical Speculative Store Bypass Barrier

 Physical Speculative Store Bypass Barrier is a memory barrier which prevents
 speculative loads from bypassing earlier stores to the same physical address.

 The semantics of the Physical Speculative Store Bypass Barrier are:

 When a load to a location appears in program order after the PSSBB, then the
 load does not speculatively read an entry earlier in the coherence order for
 that location than the entry generated by the latest store satisfying all of
 the following conditions:

 When a load to a location appears in program order before the PSSBB, then the
 load does not speculatively read data from any store satisfying all of the
 following conditions:



It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

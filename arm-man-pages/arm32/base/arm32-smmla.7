.SS SMMLA, SMMLAR
 Signed Most Significant Word Multiply Accumulate

 Signed Most Significant Word Multiply Accumulate multiplies two signed 32-bit
 values, extracts the most significant 32 bits of the result, and adds an
 accumulate value.

 Optionally, the instruction can specify that the result is rounded instead of
 being truncated. In this case, the constant 0x80000000 is added to the product
 before the high word is extracted.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then
     EncodingSpecificOperations();
     result = (SInt(R[a]) << 32) + SInt(R[n]) * SInt(R[m]);
     if round then result = result + 0x80000000;
     R[d] = result<63:32>;


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, this instruction has passed its condition execution check, and does not use R15 as either its source or destination: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

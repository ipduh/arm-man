.SS SUB (immediate, from PC)
 SUB is an alias of ADR

 Subtract from PC


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A2) and  T32 (T2).

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <c>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  For encoding A2: is the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field. If the PC is used, the instruction is a branch to the address
  calculated by the operation. This is an interworking branch, see Pseudocode
  description of operations on the AArch32 general-purpose registers and the PC.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  For encoding T2: is the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <label>
  Encoded in imm12
  For encoding A2: the label of an instruction or literal data item whose
  address is to be loaded into <Rd>. The assembler calculates the required value
  of the offset from the Align(PC, 4) value of the ADR instruction to this
  label.           If the offset is zero or positive, encoding A1 is used, with
  imm32 equal to the offset.           If the offset is negative, encoding A2 is
  used, with imm32 equal to the size of the offset. That is, the use of encoding
  A2 indicates that the required offset is minus the value of imm32.
  Permitted values of the size of the offset are any of the constants described
  in Modified immediate constants in A32 instructions.

 <label>
  Encoded in i:imm3:imm8
  For encoding T2: the label of an instruction or literal data item whose
  address is to be loaded into <Rd>. The assembler calculates the required value
  of the offset from the Align(PC, 4) value of the ADR instruction to this
  label.           If the offset is zero or positive, encoding T3 is used, with
  imm32 equal to the offset.           If the offset is negative, encoding T2 is
  used, with imm32 equal to the size of the offset. That is, the use of encoding
  T2 indicates that the required offset is minus the value of imm32.
  Permitted values of the size of the offset are 0-4095.

 <imm12>
  Encoded in i:imm3:imm8
  Is a 12-bit unsigned immediate, in the range 0 to 4095, encoded in the
  "i:imm3:imm8" field.

 <const>
  Encoded in imm12
  An immediate value. See Modified immediate constants in A32 instructions for
  the range of values.

 Unsigned Extend and Add Halfword

 Unsigned Extend and Add Halfword extracts a 16-bit value from a register, zero-
 extends it to 32 bits, adds the result to a value from another register, and
 writes the final result to the destination register. The instruction can
 specify a rotation by 0, 8, 16, or 24 bits before extracting the 16-bit value.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Operation

     EncodingSpecificOperations();
     rotated = ROR(R[m], rotation);
     R[d] = R[n] + ZeroExtend(rotated<15:0>, 32);


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, this instruction has passed its condition execution check, and does not use R15 as either its source or destination: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

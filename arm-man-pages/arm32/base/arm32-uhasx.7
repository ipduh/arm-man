 Unsigned Halving Add and Subtract with Exchange

 Unsigned Halving Add and Subtract with Exchange exchanges the two halfwords of
 the second operand, performs one unsigned 16-bit integer addition and one
 unsigned 16-bit subtraction, halves the results, and writes the results to the
 destination register.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Operation

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, this instruction has passed its condition execution check, and does not use R15 as either its source or destination: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

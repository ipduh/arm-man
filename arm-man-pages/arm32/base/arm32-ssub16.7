.SS SSUB16
 Signed Subtract 16

 Signed Subtract 16 performs two 16-bit signed integer subtractions, and writes
 the results to the destination register. It sets PSTATE.GE according to the
 results of the subtractions.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, this instruction has passed its condition execution check, and does not use R15 as either its source or destination: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

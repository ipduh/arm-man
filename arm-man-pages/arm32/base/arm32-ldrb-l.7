 Load Register Byte (literal)

 Load Register Byte (literal) calculates an address from the PC value and an
 immediate offset, loads a byte from memory, zero-extends it to form a 32-bit
 word, and writes it to a register. For information about memory accesses see
 Memory accesses.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <c>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <Rt>
  Encoded in Rt
  Is the general-purpose register to be transferred, encoded in the "Rt" field.

 <label>
  Encoded in imm12
  The label of the literal data item that is to be loaded into <Rt>. The
  assembler calculates the required value of the offset from the Align(PC, 4)
  value of the instruction to this label. Permitted values of the offset are
  -4095 to 4095.           If the offset is zero or positive, imm32 is equal to
  the offset and add == TRUE, encoded as U == 1.           If the offset is
  negative, imm32 is equal to minus the offset and add == FALSE, encoded as U ==
  0.

 +/-
  Encoded in U
  Specifies the offset is added to or subtracted from the base register,
  defaulting to + if omitted and

  U +/- 
  0 -   
  1 +   

 <imm>
  Encoded in imm12
  For encoding A1: is the 12-bit unsigned immediate byte offset, in the range 0
  to 4095, defaulting to 0 if omitted, and encoded in the "imm12" field.

 <imm>
  Encoded in imm12
  For encoding T1: is a 12-bit unsigned immediate byte offset, in the range 0 to
  4095, encoded in the "imm12" field.



.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then
     EncodingSpecificOperations();
     base = Align(PC,4);
     address = if add then (base + imm32) else (base - imm32);
     R[t] = ZeroExtend(MemU[address,1], 32);


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

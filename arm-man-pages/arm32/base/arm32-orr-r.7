.SS ORR, ORRS (register)
 Bitwise OR (register)

 Bitwise OR (register) performs a bitwise (inclusive) OR of a register value and
 an optionally-shifted register value, and writes the result to the destination
 register.

 If the destination register is not the PC, the ORRS variant of the instruction
 updates the condition flags based on the result.

 The field descriptions for <Rd> identify the encodings where the PC is
 permitted as the destination register. ARM deprecates any use of these
 encodings. However, when the destination register is the PC:

 The ORR variant of the instruction is an interworking branch, see Pseudocode
 description of operations on the AArch32 general-purpose registers and the PC.

 The ORRS variant of the instruction performs an exception return without the
 use of the stack. In this case:
 The PE branches to the address written to the PC, and restores PSTATE from
 SPSR_<current_mode>.

 The PE checks SPSR_<current_mode> for an illegal return event.  See Illegal
 return events from AArch32 state.

 The instruction is undefined in Hyp mode.

 The instruction is constrained unpredictable in User mode and System mode.



 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.

  the operation. This is an interworking branch, see Pseudocode description of

  restores PSTATE from SPSR_<current_mode>.

  <amount> modulo 32.

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm3:imm2

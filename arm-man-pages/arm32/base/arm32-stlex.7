 Store-Release Exclusive Word

 Store-Release Exclusive Word stores a word from a register to memory if the
 executing PE has exclusive access to the memory at that address, and returns a
 status value of 0 if the store was successful, or of 1 if no store was
 performed.

 The instruction also has memory ordering semantics as described in Load-
 Acquire, Store-Release.

 For more information about support for shared memory see Synchronization and
 semaphores. For information about memory accesses see Memory accesses.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <c>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the destination general-purpose register into which the status result of
  the store exclusive is written, encoded in the "Rd" field. The value returned
  is:                                       0If the operation updates memory.
  1If the operation fails to update memory.

 <Rt>
  Encoded in Rt
  Is the general-purpose register to be transferred, encoded in the "Rt" field.

 <Rn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the general-purpose base register, encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then
     EncodingSpecificOperations();
     address = R[n];
     if AArch32.ExclusiveMonitorsPass(address,4) then
         MemO[address, 4] = R[t];
         R[d] = ZeroExtend('0');
     else
         R[d] = ZeroExtend('1');


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

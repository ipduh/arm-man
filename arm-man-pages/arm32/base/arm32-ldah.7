 Load-Acquire Halfword

 Load-Acquire Halfword loads a halfword from memory, zero-extends it to form a
 32-bit word and writes it to a register. The instruction also has memory
 ordering semantics as described in Load-Acquire, Store-Release.

 For more information about support for shared memory see Synchronization and
 semaphores. For information about memory accesses see Memory accesses.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior, see
 Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <c>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <Rt>
  Encoded in Rt
  Is the general-purpose register to be transferred, encoded in the "Rt" field.

 <Rn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the general-purpose base register, encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then
     EncodingSpecificOperations();
     address = R[n];
     R[t] = ZeroExtend(MemO[address, 2], 32);


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

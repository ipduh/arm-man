.SS EOR, EORS (immediate)
 Bitwise Exclusive OR (immediate)

 Bitwise Exclusive OR (immediate) performs a bitwise Exclusive OR of a register
 value and an immediate value, and writes the result to the destination
 register.

 If the destination register is not the PC, the EORS variant of the instruction
 updates the condition flags based on the result.

 The field descriptions for <Rd> identify the encodings where the PC is
 permitted as the destination register. Arm deprecates any use of these
 encodings. However, when the destination register is the PC:

 The EOR variant of the instruction is an interworking branch, see Pseudocode
 description of operations on the AArch32 general-purpose registers and the PC.

 The EORS variant of the instruction performs an exception return without the
 use of the stack. In this case:
 The PE branches to the address written to the PC, and restores PSTATE from
 SPSR_<current_mode>.

 The PE checks SPSR_<current_mode> for an illegal return event.  See Illegal
 return events from AArch32 state.

 The instruction is undefined in Hyp mode.

 The instruction is constrained unpredictable in User mode and System mode.



 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior, see
 Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

  For the EOR variant, the instruction is a branch to the address calculated by
  the operation. This is an interworking branch, see Pseudocode description of

  restores PSTATE from SPSR_<current_mode>.

     result = R[n] EOR imm32;
     if d == 15 then          // Can only occur for A32 encoding
         if setflags then
             ALUExceptionReturn(result);
         else
             ALUWritePC(result);
     else
         R[d] = result;
         if setflags then

             PSTATE.Z = IsZeroBit(result);
             PSTATE.C = carry;

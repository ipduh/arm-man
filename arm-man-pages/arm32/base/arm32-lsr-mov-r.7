.SS LSR (immediate)
 LSR is an alias of MOV

 Logical Shift Right (immediate)

 Logical Shift Right (immediate) shifts a register value right by an immediate
 number of bits, shifting in zeros, and writes the result to the destination
 register.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T2 and T3).

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <c>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  For encoding A1: is the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field. Arm deprecates using the PC as the destination register, but if
  the PC is used, the instruction is a branch to the address calculated by the
  operation. This is an interworking branch, see Pseudocode description of
  operations on the AArch32 general-purpose registers and the PC.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  For encoding T2 and T3: is the general-purpose destination register, encoded
  in the "Rd" field.

 <Rm>
  Encoded in Rm
  For encoding A1: is the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field. The PC can be used, but this is deprecated.

 <Rm>
  Encoded in Rm
  For encoding T2 and T3: is the general-purpose source register, encoded in the
  "Rm" field.

 <imm>
  Encoded in imm5
  For encoding A1 and T2: is the shift amount, in the range 1 to 32, encoded in
  the "imm5" field as <imm> modulo 32.

 <imm>
  Encoded in imm3:imm2
  For encoding T3: is the shift amount, in the range 1 to 32, encoded in the
  "imm3:imm2" field as <imm> modulo 32.

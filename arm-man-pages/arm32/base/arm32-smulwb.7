 Signed Multiply (word by halfword)

 Signed Multiply (word by halfword) multiplies a signed 32-bit quantity and a
 signed 16-bit quantity. The signed 16-bit quantity is taken from either the
 bottom or the top half of its source register. The other half of the second
 source register is ignored. The top 32 bits of the 48-bit product are written
 to the destination register. The bottom 16 bits of the 48-bit product are
 ignored. No overflow is possible during this instruction.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <c>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the "Rd" field.

 <Rn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the first general-purpose source register holding the multiplicand, encoded
  in the "Rn" field.

 <Rm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the second general-purpose source register holding the multiplier in the
  bottom or top half (selected by <y>), encoded in the "Rm" field.



.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then
     EncodingSpecificOperations();
     operand2 = if m_high then R[m]<31:16> else R[m]<15:0>;
     product = SInt(R[n]) * SInt(operand2);
     R[d] = product<47:16>;
     // Signed overflow cannot occur


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, this instruction has passed its condition execution check, and does not use R15 as either its source or destination: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

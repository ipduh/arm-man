 Reverse Bits

 Reverse Bits reverses the bit order in a 32-bit register.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <c>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the "Rd" field.

 <Rm>
  Encoded in Rm
  For encoding A1: is the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field.

 <Rm>
  Encoded in Rm
  For encoding T1: is the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field. It must be encoded with an identical value in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then
     EncodingSpecificOperations();
     bits(32) result;
     for i = 0 to 31
         result<31-i> = R[m]<i>;
     R[d] = result;


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, this instruction has passed its condition execution check, and does not use R15 as either its source or destination: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

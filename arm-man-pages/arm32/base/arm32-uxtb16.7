.SS UXTB16
 Unsigned Extend Byte 16

 Unsigned Extend Byte 16 extracts two 8-bit values from a register, zero-extends
 them to 16 bits each, and writes the results to the destination register. The
 instruction can specify a rotation by 0, 8, 16, or 24 bits before extracting
 the 8-bit values.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

  Encoded in Rm
  For encoding A1: is the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field.

 <Rm>
  Encoded in Rm
  For encoding T1: is the second general-purpose source register, encoded in the
  "Rm" field.

 <amount>
  Encoded in rotate
  Is the rotate amount,

  rotate <amount>

.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then
     EncodingSpecificOperations();
     rotated = ROR(R[m], rotation);
     R[d]<15:0>  = ZeroExtend(rotated<7:0>, 16);
     R[d]<31:16> = ZeroExtend(rotated<23:16>, 16);


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, this instruction has passed its condition execution check, and does not use R15 as either its source or destination: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

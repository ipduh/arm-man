.SS RSC, RSCS (register)
 Reverse Subtract with Carry (register)

 Reverse Subtract with Carry (register) subtracts a register value and the value
 of NOT (Carry flag) from an optionally-shifted register value, and writes the
 result to the destination register.

 If the destination register is not the PC, the RSCS variant of the instruction
 updates the condition flags based on the result.

 The field descriptions for <Rd> identify the encodings where the PC is
 permitted as the destination register. ARM deprecates any use of these
 encodings. However, when the destination register is the PC:

 The RSC variant of the instruction is an interworking branch, see Pseudocode
 description of operations on the AArch32 general-purpose registers and the PC.

 The RSCS variant of the instruction performs an exception return without the
 use of the stack. In this case:
 The PE branches to the address written to the PC, and restores PSTATE from
 SPSR_<current_mode>.

 The PE checks SPSR_<current_mode> for an illegal return event.  See Illegal
 return events from AArch32 state.

 The instruction is undefined in Hyp mode.

 The instruction is constrained unpredictable in User mode and System mode.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <c>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the "Rd" field. If
  omitted, this register is the same as <Rn>. Arm deprecates using the PC as the
  destination register, but if the PC is used:                        For the
  RSC variant, the instruction is a branch to the address calculated by the
  operation. This is an interworking branch, see Pseudocode description of
  operations on the AArch32 general-purpose registers and the PC.
  For the RSCS variant, the instruction performs an exception return, that
  restores PSTATE from SPSR_<current_mode>.

 <Rn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the first general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rn" field. The
  PC can be used, but this is deprecated.

 <Rm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the second general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm" field. The
  PC can be used, but this is deprecated.

 <shift>
  Encoded in stype
  Is the type of shift to be applied to the second source register,

  stype <shift> 
  00    LSL     
  01    LSR     
  10    ASR     
  11    ROR     

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm5
  Is the shift amount, in the range 1 to 31 (when <shift> = LSL or ROR) or 1 to
  32 (when <shift> = LSR or ASR) encoded in the "imm5" field as <amount> modulo
  32.



.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then

         if setflags then
             PSTATE.<N,Z,C,V> = nzcv;


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1 and this instruction does not use R15 as either its source or destination: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

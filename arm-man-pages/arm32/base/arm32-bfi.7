 Bit Field Insert

 Bit Field Insert copies any number of low order bits from a register into the
 same number of adjacent bits at any position in the destination register.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <c>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the "Rd" field.

 <Rn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rn" field.

 <lsb>
  Encoded in lsb
  For encoding A1: is the least significant destination bit, in the range 0 to
  31, encoded in the "lsb" field.

 <lsb>
  Encoded in imm3:imm2
  For encoding T1: is the least significant destination bit, in the range 0 to
  31, encoded in the "imm3:imm2" field.

 <width>
  Encoded in msb
  Is the number of bits to be copied, in the range 1 to 32-<lsb>, encoded in the
  "msb" field as <lsb>+<width>-1.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, this instruction has passed its condition execution check, and does not use R15 as either its source or destination: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

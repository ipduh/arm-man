.SS PUSH (multiple registers)
 PUSH is an alias of STM

 Push multiple registers to Stack


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <c>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <registers>
  For encoding A1: is a list of two or more registers to be stored, separated by
  commas and surrounded by { and }. The lowest-numbered register is stored to
  the lowest memory address, through to the highest-numbered register to the
  highest memory address. See also Encoding of lists of general-purpose
  registers and the PC.           The SP and PC can be in the list. However:
  Arm deprecates the use of instructions that include the PC in the list.
  If the SP is in the list, and it is not the lowest-numbered register in the
  list, the instruction stores an unknown value for the SP.

 <registers>
  Encoded in register_list
  For encoding T1: is a list of one or more registers to be stored, separated by
  commas and surrounded by { and }. The lowest-numbered register is stored to
  the lowest memory address, through to the highest-numbered register to the
  highest memory address. See also Encoding of lists of general-purpose
  registers and the PC.           The registers in the list must be in the range
  R0-R12, encoded in the "register_list" field, and can optionally contain the
  LR. If the LR is in the list, the "M" field is set to 1, otherwise it defaults
  to 0.



.SS Operation

 The manual of STM gives pseudocode for PUSH.

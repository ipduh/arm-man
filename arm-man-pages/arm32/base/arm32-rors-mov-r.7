.SS RORS (immediate)
 RORS is an alias of MOVS

 Rotate Right, setting flags (immediate)

 Rotate Right, setting flags (immediate) provides the value of the contents of a
 register rotated by a constant value. The bits that are rotated off the right
 end are inserted into the vacated bit positions on the left.

 If the destination register is not the PC, this instruction updates the
 condition flags based on the result.

 The field descriptions for <Rd> identify the encodings where the PC is
 permitted as the destination register. Arm deprecates any use of these
 encodings. However, when the destination register is the PC:

 The PE branches to the address written to the PC, and restores PSTATE from
 SPSR_<current_mode>.

 The PE checks SPSR_<current_mode> for an illegal return event.  See Illegal
 return events from AArch32 state.

 The instruction is undefined in Hyp mode.

 The instruction is constrained unpredictable in User mode and System mode.



It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T3).

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <c>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  For encoding A1: is the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field. Arm deprecates using the PC as the destination register, but if
  the PC is used, the instruction performs an exception return, that restores
  PSTATE from SPSR_<current_mode>.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  For encoding T3: is the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Rm>
  Encoded in Rm
  For encoding A1: is the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field. The PC can be used, but this is deprecated.

 <Rm>
  Encoded in Rm
  For encoding T3: is the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field.

 <imm>
  Encoded in imm5
  For encoding A1: is the shift amount, in the range 1 to 31, encoded in the
  "imm5" field.

 <imm>
  Encoded in imm3:imm2
  For encoding T3: is the shift amount, in the range 1 to 31, encoded in the
  "imm3:imm2" field.

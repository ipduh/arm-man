.SS SUB, SUBS (register)
 Subtract (register)

 Subtract (register) subtracts an optionally-shifted register value from a
 register value, and writes the result to the destination register.

 If the destination register is not the PC, the SUBS variant of the instruction
 updates the condition flags based on the result.

 The field descriptions for <Rd> identify the encodings where the PC is
 permitted as the destination register. However, when the destination register
 is the PC:

 The SUB variant of the instruction is an interworking branch, see Pseudocode
 description of operations on the AArch32 general-purpose registers and the PC.

 The SUBS variant of the instruction performs an exception return without the
 use of the stack. Arm deprecates use of this instruction. However, in this
 case:
 The PE branches to the address written to the PC, and restores PSTATE from
 SPSR_<current_mode>.

 The PE checks SPSR_<current_mode> for an illegal return event.  See Illegal
 return events from AArch32 state.

 The instruction is undefined in Hyp mode.

 The instruction is constrained unpredictable in User mode and System mode.



 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1 and T2).

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  For encoding A1: is the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field. If omitted, this register is the same as <Rn>. Arm deprecates
  using the PC as the destination register, but if the PC is used:
  For the SUB variant, the instruction is a branch to the address calculated by
  the operation. This is an interworking branch, see Pseudocode description of
  operations on the AArch32 general-purpose registers and the PC.
  For the SUBS variant, the instruction performs an exception return, that
  restores PSTATE from SPSR_<current_mode>.

 <Rd>
  Encoded in Rd
  For encoding T1 and T2: is the general-purpose destination register, encoded
  in the "Rd" field. If omitted, this register is the same as <Rn>.

 <Rn>
  Encoded in Rn
  For encoding A1: is the first general-purpose source register, encoded in the
  "Rn" field. The PC can be used, but this is deprecated. If the SP is used, see

  "Rn" field.

 <Rn>
  Encoded in Rn

 <Rm>
  Encoded in Rm

  "Rm" field. The PC can be used, but this is deprecated.

 <Rm>
  Encoded in Rm
  For encoding T1 and T2: is the second general-purpose source register, encoded
  in the "Rm" field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in stype
  Is the type of shift to be applied to the second source register,

  stype <shift> 
  00    LSL     
  01    LSR     
  10    ASR     
  11    ROR     

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm5
  For encoding A1: is the shift amount, in the range 1 to 31 (when <shift> = LSL
  or ROR) or 1 to 32 (when <shift> = LSR or ASR) encoded in the "imm5" field as
  <amount> modulo 32.

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm3:imm2
  For encoding T2: is the shift amount, in the range 1 to 31 (when <shift> = LSL
  or ROR) or 1 to 32 (when <shift> = LSR or ASR), encoded in the "imm3:imm2"
  field as <amount> modulo 32.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1 and this instruction does not use R15 as either its source or destination: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

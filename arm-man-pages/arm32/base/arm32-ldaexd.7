 Load-Acquire Exclusive Doubleword

 Load-Acquire Exclusive Doubleword loads a doubleword from memory, writes it to
 two registers and:


 The instruction also acts as a barrier instruction with the ordering
 requirements described in Load-Acquire, Store-Release.

 For more information about support for shared memory see Synchronization and
 semaphores. For information about memory accesses see Memory accesses.

 For more information about the constrained unpredictable behavior of this
 instruction, see Architectural Constraints on UNPREDICTABLE behaviors.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

 <q>
  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <Rt>
  Encoded in Rt
  For encoding A1: is the first general-purpose register to be transferred,
  encoded in the "Rt" field. <Rt> must be even-numbered and not R14.

 <Rt>
  Encoded in Rt
  For encoding T1: is the first general-purpose register to be transferred,
  encoded in the "Rt" field.

 <Rt2>
  For encoding A1: is the second general-purpose register to be transferred.
  <Rt2> must be <R(t+1)>.

 <Rt2>
  Encoded in Rt2
  For encoding T1: is the second general-purpose register to be transferred,
  encoded in the "Rt2" field.

 <Rn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the general-purpose base register, encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then
     EncodingSpecificOperations();
     address = R[n];
     AArch32.SetExclusiveMonitors(address, 8);
     value = MemO[address, 8];
     // Extract words from 64-bit loaded value such that R[t] is
     // loaded from address and R[t2] from address+4.
     R[t]  = if BigEndian() then value<63:32> else value<31:0>;
     R[t2] = if BigEndian() then value<31:0>  else value<63:32>;


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

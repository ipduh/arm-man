 Vector Multiply Subtract Long (integer)

 Vector Multiply Subtract Long multiplies corresponding elements in two vectors,
 and subtract the products from the corresponding elements of the destination
 vector. The destination vector element is twice as long as the elements that
 are multiplied.

 Depending on settings in the CPACR, NSACR, and HCPTR registers, and the
 Security state and PE mode in which the instruction is executed, an attempt to
 execute the instruction might be undefined, or trapped to Hyp mode. For more
 information see Enabling Advanced SIMD and floating-point support.

 set, or Advanced SIMD data-processing for the A32 instruction set.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

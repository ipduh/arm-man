.SS VCLZ
 Vector Count Leading Zeros

 Vector Count Leading Zeros counts the number of consecutive zeros, starting
 from the most significant bit, in each element in a vector, and places the
 results in a second vector.

 The operand vector elements can be any one of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit
 integers. There is no distinction between signed and unsigned integers.

 The result vector elements are the same data type as the operand vector
 elements.

 Depending on settings in the CPACR, NSACR, and HCPTR registers, and the
 Security state and PE mode in which the instruction is executed, an attempt to
 execute the instruction might be undefined, or trapped to Hyp mode. For more
 information see Enabling Advanced SIMD and floating-point support.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then
     EncodingSpecificOperations();  CheckAdvSIMDEnabled();
     for r = 0 to regs-1

 If CPSR.DIT is 1 and this instruction passes its condition execution check: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

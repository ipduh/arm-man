 Vector Transpose

 Vector Transpose treats the elements of its operand vectors as elements of 2 x
 2 matrices, and transposes the matrices.

 The elements of the vectors can be 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit. There is no
 distinction between data types.



 Depending on settings in the CPACR, NSACR, and HCPTR registers, and the
 Security state and PE mode in which the instruction is executed, an attempt to
 execute the instruction might be undefined, or trapped to Hyp mode. For more
 information see Enabling Advanced SIMD and floating-point support.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1 and this instruction passes its condition execution check: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

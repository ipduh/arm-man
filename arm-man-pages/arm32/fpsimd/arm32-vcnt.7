 Vector Count Set Bits

 Vector Count Set Bits counts the number of bits that are one in each element in
 a vector, and places the results in a second vector.

 The operand vector elements must be 8-bit fields.

 The result vector elements are 8-bit integers.

 Depending on settings in the CPACR, NSACR, and HCPTR registers, and the
 Security state and PE mode in which the instruction is executed, an attempt to
 execute the instruction might be undefined, or trapped to Hyp mode. For more
 information see Enabling Advanced SIMD and floating-point support.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then
     EncodingSpecificOperations();  CheckAdvSIMDEnabled();
     for r = 0 to regs-1
         for e = 0 to elements-1
             Elem[D[d+r],e,esize] = BitCount(Elem[D[m+r],e,esize])<esize-1:0>;


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1 and this instruction passes its condition execution check: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

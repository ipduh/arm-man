.SS VORN (register)
 Vector bitwise OR NOT (register)

 Vector bitwise OR NOT (register) performs a bitwise OR NOT operation between
 two registers, and places the result in the destination register.  The operand
 and result registers can be quadword or doubleword.  They must all be the same
 size.

 Depending on settings in the CPACR, NSACR, and HCPTR registers, and the
 Security state and PE mode in which the instruction is executed, an attempt to
 execute the instruction might be undefined, or trapped to Hyp mode. For more
 information see Enabling Advanced SIMD and floating-point support.


It has encodings from the following instruction sets:  A32 (A1) and  T32 (T1).

 <c>
  For encoding A1: see Standard assembler syntax fields. This encoding must be
  unconditional.

  See Standard assembler syntax fields.

 <dt>
  An optional data type. It is ignored by assemblers, and does not affect the
  encoding.

 <Qd>
  Encoded in D:Vd
  Is the 128-bit name of the SIMD&FP destination register, encoded in the "D:Vd"
  field as <Qd>*2.

  "M:Vm" field as <Qm>*2.

 <Dd>
  Encoded in D:Vd
  Is the 64-bit name of the SIMD&FP destination register, encoded in the "D:Vd"
  field.

 <Dn>
  Encoded in N:Vn

  field.

 <Dm>

.SS Operation

 if ConditionPassed() then
     EncodingSpecificOperations();  CheckAdvSIMDEnabled();
     for r = 0 to regs-1
         D[d+r] = D[n+r] OR NOT(D[m+r]);


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If CPSR.DIT is 1 and this instruction passes its condition execution check: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

.SS MOVS (unpredicated)
 MOVS is an alias of ORRS

 Move predicate (unpredicated), setting the condition flags

 Read all elements from the source predicate and place in the destination
 predicate. This instruction is unpredicated. Sets the First (N), None (Z),
 !Last (C) condition flags based on the predicate result, and the V flag to
 zero.

.SS CMPLS (vectors)
 CMPLS is an alias of CMPHS

 Compare unsigned lower or same as vector, setting the condition flags

 Compare active unsigned integer elements in the first source vector being lower
 than or same as corresponding unsigned elements in the second source vector,
 and place the boolean results of the comparison in the corresponding elements
 of the destination predicate. Inactive elements in the destination predicate
 register are set to zero. Sets the First (N), None (Z), !Last (C) condition
 flags based on the predicate result, and the V flag to zero.

.SS MOV (bitmask immediate)
 MOV is an alias of DUPM

 Move logical bitmask immediate to vector (unpredicated)

 Unconditionally broadcast the logical bitmask immediate into each element of
 the destination vector. This instruction is unpredicated. The immediate is a
 64-bit value consisting of a single run of ones or zeros repeating every 2, 4,
 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits.

  64 bit fields, each field containing a rotated run of non-zero bits, encoded
  in the "imm13" field.

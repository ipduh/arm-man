.SS MOV (immediate, unpredicated)
 MOV is an alias of DUP

 Move signed immediate to vector elements (unpredicated)

 Unconditionally broadcast the signed integer immediate into each element of the
 destination vector. This instruction is unpredicated.

 The immediate operand is a signed value in the range -128 to +127, and for
 element widths of 16 bits or higher it may also be a signed multiple of 256 in
 the range -32768 to +32512 (excluding 0).

 The immediate is encoded in 8 bits with an optional left shift by 8. The
 preferred disassembly when the shift option is specified is "#<simm8>, LSL #8".
 However an assembler and disassembler may also allow use of the shifted 16-bit
 value unless the immediate is 0 and the shift amount is 8, which must be
 unambiguously described as "#0, LSL #8".

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Zd>
  Encoded in Zd
  Is the name of the destination scalable vector register, encoded in the "Zd"
  field.

 <T>
  Encoded in size
  Is the size specifier,

  size <T> 
  00   B   
  01   H   
  10   S   
  11   D   

 <imm>
  Encoded in imm8
  Is a signed immediate in the range -128 to 127, encoded in the "imm8" field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in sh
  Is the optional left shift to apply to the immediate, defaulting to LSL #0 and

  sh <shift> 
  0  LSL #0  
  1  LSL #8

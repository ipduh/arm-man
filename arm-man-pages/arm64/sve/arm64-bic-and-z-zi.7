.SS BIC (immediate)
 BIC is an alias of AND

 Bitwise clear bits using immediate (unpredicated)

 Bitwise clear bits using immediate with each 64-bit element of the source
 vector, and destructively place the results in the corresponding elements of
 the source vector. The immediate is a 64-bit value consisting of a single run
 of ones or zeros repeating every 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits. This instruction
 is unpredicated.

 Status : Green

 Predicated : False

 takes_pred_movprfx : False

 <Zdn>
  Encoded in Zdn
  Is the name of the source and destination scalable vector register, encoded in
  the "Zdn" field.

 <T>
  Encoded in imm13<12>:imm13<5:0>
  Is the size specifier,

 <const>
  Encoded in imm13
  Is a 64, 32, 16 or 8-bit bitmask consisting of replicated 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or
  64 bit fields, each field containing a rotated run of non-zero bits, encoded
  in the "imm13" field.

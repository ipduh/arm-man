.SS MOV (immediate, predicated, zeroing)
 MOV is an alias of CPY

 Move signed integer immediate to vector elements (zeroing)

 Move a signed integer immediate to each active element in the destination
 vector. Inactive elements in the destination vector register are set to zero.

 The immediate operand is a signed value in the range -128 to +127, and for
 element widths of 16 bits or higher it may also be a signed multiple of 256 in
 the range -32768 to +32512 (excluding 0).

 The immediate is encoded in 8 bits with an optional left shift by 8. The
 preferred disassembly when the shift option is specified is "#<simm8>, LSL #8".
 However an assembler and disassembler may also allow use of the shifted 16-bit
 value unless the immediate is 0 and the shift amount is 8, which must be
 unambiguously described as "#0, LSL #8".

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Zd>
  Encoded in Zd
  Is the name of the destination scalable vector register, encoded in the "Zd"
  field.

 <T>
  Encoded in size
  Is the size specifier,

  size <T> 
  00   B   
  01   H   
  10   S   
  11   D   

 <Pg>
  Encoded in Pg
  Is the name of the governing scalable predicate register, encoded in the "Pg"
  field.

 <imm>
  Encoded in imm8
  Is a signed immediate in the range -128 to 127, encoded in the "imm8" field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in sh
  Is the optional left shift to apply to the immediate, defaulting to LSL #0 and

  sh <shift> 
  0  LSL #0  
  1  LSL #8

.TH "MOV (scalar, unpredicated)" "7" " "  "alias" "sve"
.SS MOV (scalar, unpredicated)
 MOV is an alias of DUP

 Move general-purpose register to vector elements (unpredicated)

 Unconditionally broadcast the general-purpose scalar source register into each
 element of the destination vector. This instruction is unpredicated.

 Status : Green

 Predicated : False

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Zd>
  Encoded in Zd
  Is the name of the destination scalable vector register, encoded in the "Zd"
  field.

 <T>
  Encoded in size
  Is the size specifier,

  size <T> 
  00   B   
  01   H   
  10   S   
  11   D   

 <R>
  Encoded in size
  Is a width specifier,

  size <R> 
  01   W   
  x0   W   
  11   X   

 <n|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the number [0-30] of the general-purpose source register or the name SP
  (31), encoded in the "Rn" field.

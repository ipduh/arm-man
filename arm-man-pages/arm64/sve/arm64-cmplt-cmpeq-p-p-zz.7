.SS CMPLT (vectors)
 CMPLT is an alias of CMPGT

 Compare signed less than vector, setting the condition flags

 Compare active signed integer elements in the first source vector being less
 than corresponding signed elements in the second source vector, and place the
 boolean results of the comparison in the corresponding elements of the
 destination predicate. Inactive elements in the destination predicate register
 are set to zero. Sets the First (N), None (Z), !Last (C) condition flags based
 on the predicate result, and the V flag to zero.

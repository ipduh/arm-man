.SS FACLT
 FACLT is an alias of FACGT

 Floating-point absolute compare less than

 Compare active absolute values of floating-point elements in the first source
 vector being less than corresponding absolute values of elements in the second
 source vector, and place the boolean results of the comparison in the
 corresponding elements of the destination predicate. Inactive elements in the
 destination predicate register are set to zero. Does not set the condition
 flags.

 Status : Green

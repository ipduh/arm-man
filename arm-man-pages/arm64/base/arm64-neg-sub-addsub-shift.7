 NEG is an alias of SUB

 Negate (shifted register)

 Negate (shifted register) negates an optionally-shifted register value, and
 writes the result to the destination register.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Wm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field.

 <Xd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Xm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in shift
  Is the optional shift type to be applied to the second source operand,
  defaulting to LSL and

  shift <shift>  
  00    LSL      
  01    LSR      
  10    ASR      
  11    RESERVED 

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm6
  For the 32-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 31, defaulting
  to 0 and encoded in the "imm6" field.

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm6
  For the 64-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 63, defaulting
  to 0 and encoded in the "imm6" field.

 The manual of SUB gives pseudocode for NEG.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

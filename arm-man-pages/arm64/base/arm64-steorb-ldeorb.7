.SS STEORB, STEORLB
 STEORLB is an alias of LDEORLB

 Atomic exclusive OR on byte in memory, without return

 Atomic exclusive OR on byte in memory, without return, atomically loads an
 8-bit byte from memory, performs an exclusive OR with the value held in a
 register on it, and stores the result back to memory.

 STEORB has no memory ordering semantics.

 STEORLB stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.

 STEORLB stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.


 For information about memory accesses see Load/Store addressing modes.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Ws>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of LDEORLB gives pseudocode for STEORLB.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

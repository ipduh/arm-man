.SS LDSET, LDSETA, LDSETAL, LDSETL
 Atomic bit set on word or doubleword in memory

 Atomic bit set on word or doubleword in memory atomically loads a 32-bit word
 or 64-bit doubleword from memory, performs a bitwise OR with the value held in
 a register on it, and stores the result back to memory. The value initially
 loaded from memory is returned in the destination register.

 If the destination register is not one of WZR or XZR, LDSETA and LDSETAL load
 from memory with acquire semantics.

 If the destination register is not one of WZR or XZR, LDSETA and LDSETAL load
 from memory with acquire semantics.

 If the destination register is not one of WZR or XZR, LDSETA and LDSETAL load
 from memory with acquire semantics.

 If the destination register is not one of WZR or XZR, LDSETA and LDSETAL load
 from memory with acquire semantics.

 LDSETL and LDSETAL store to memory with release semantics.

 LDSETL and LDSETAL store to memory with release semantics.

 LDSET has no memory ordering requirements.


 For more information about memory ordering semantics see Load-Acquire, Store-
 Release.

 For information about memory accesses see Load/Store addressing modes.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Ws>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Wt>
  Encoded in Rt
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register to be loaded, encoded in
  the "Rt" field.

 <Xs>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xt>
  Encoded in Rt
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose register to be loaded, encoded in
  the "Rt" field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.

 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

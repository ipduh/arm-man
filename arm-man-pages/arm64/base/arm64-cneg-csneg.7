 Conditional Negate

 Conditional Negate returns, in the destination register, the negated value of
 the source register if the condition is TRUE, and otherwise returns the value
 of the source register.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Wn>
  Encoded in Rm:Rn
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rn"
  and "Rm" fields.

 <Xd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Xn>
  Encoded in Rm:Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rn"
  and "Rm" fields.

 <cond>
  Encoded in cond
  Is one of the standard conditions, excluding AL and NV, encoded in the "cond"
  field with its least significant bit inverted.



.SS Operation

 The manual of CSNEG gives pseudocode for CNEG.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

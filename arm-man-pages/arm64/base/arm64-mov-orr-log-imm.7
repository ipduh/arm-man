.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd|WSP>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the destination general-purpose register or stack
  pointer, encoded in the "Rd" field.

 <Xd|SP>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the destination general-purpose register or stack
  pointer, encoded in the "Rd" field.

 <imm>
  Encoded in immr:imms
  For the 32-bit variant: is the bitmask immediate, encoded in "imms:immr", but
  excluding values which could be encoded by MOVZ or MOVN.

 <imm>
  Encoded in N:immr:imms
  For the 64-bit variant: is the bitmask immediate, encoded in "N:imms:immr",
  but excluding values which could be encoded by MOVZ or MOVN.



.SS Operation

 The manual of ORR gives pseudocode for MOV.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

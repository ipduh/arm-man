 Count Leading Zeros

 Count Leading Zeros counts the number of binary zero bits before the first
 binary one bit in the value of the source register, and writes the result to
 the destination register.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Wn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rn"
  field.

 <Xd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Xn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rn"
  field.



.SS Operation

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

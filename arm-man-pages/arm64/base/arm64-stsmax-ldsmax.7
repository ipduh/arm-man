.SS STSMAX, STSMAXL
 STSMAXL is an alias of LDSMAXL

 Atomic signed maximum on word or doubleword in memory, without return

 Atomic signed maximum on word or doubleword in memory, without return,
 atomically loads a 32-bit word or 64-bit doubleword from memory, compares it
 against the value held in a register, and stores the larger value back to
 memory, treating the values as signed numbers.

 STSMAX has no memory ordering semantics.

 STSMAXL stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.

 STSMAXL stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Ws>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xs>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of LDSMAXL gives pseudocode for STSMAXL.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

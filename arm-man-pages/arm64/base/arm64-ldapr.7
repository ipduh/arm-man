 Load-Acquire RCpc Register

 Load-Acquire RCpc Register derives an address from a base register value, loads
 a 32-bit word or 64-bit doubleword from the derived address in memory, and
 writes it to a register.

 The instruction has memory ordering semantics as described in Load-Acquire,
 Load-AcquirePC, and Store-Release, except that:


 This difference in memory ordering is not described in the pseudocode.

 For information about memory accesses, see Load/Store addressing modes.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wt>
  Encoded in Rt
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register to be loaded, encoded in
  the "Rt" field.

 <Xt>
  Encoded in Rt
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose register to be loaded, encoded in
  the "Rt" field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 X[t] = ZeroExtend(data, regsize);


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

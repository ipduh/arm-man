 Compare Negative (shifted register)

 Compare Negative (shifted register) adds a register value and an optionally-
 shifted register value. It updates the condition flags based on the result, and
 discards the result.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 32-bit name of the first general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rn" field.

 <Wm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 32-bit name of the second general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rm" field.

 <Xn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the first general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rn" field.

 <Xm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 64-bit name of the second general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rm" field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in shift
  Is the optional shift type to be applied to the second source operand,
  defaulting to LSL and

  shift <shift>  
  00    LSL      
  01    LSR      
  10    ASR      
  11    RESERVED 

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm6
  For the 32-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 31, defaulting
  to 0 and encoded in the "imm6" field.

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm6
  For the 64-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 63, defaulting
  to 0 and encoded in the "imm6" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of ADDS gives pseudocode for CMN.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

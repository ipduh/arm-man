.SS STEORH, STEORLH
 STEORLH is an alias of LDEORLH

 Atomic exclusive OR on halfword in memory, without return

 Atomic exclusive OR on halfword in memory, without return, atomically loads a
 16-bit halfword from memory, performs an exclusive OR with the value held in a
 register on it, and stores the result back to memory.

 STEORH has no memory ordering semantics.

 STEORLH stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.

 STEORLH stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.


 For information about memory accesses see Load/Store addressing modes.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Ws>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of LDEORLH gives pseudocode for STEORLH.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

.SS SUB (extended register)
 Subtract (extended register)

 Subtract (extended register) subtracts a sign or zero-extended register value,
 followed by an optional left shift amount, from a register value, and writes
 the result to the destination register. The argument that is extended from the
 <Rm> register can be a byte, halfword, word, or doubleword.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd|WSP>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the destination general-purpose register or stack
  pointer, encoded in the "Rd" field.

 <Wn|WSP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 32-bit name of the first source general-purpose register or stack
  pointer, encoded in the "Rn" field.

 <Wm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 32-bit name of the second general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rm" field.

 <Xd|SP>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the destination general-purpose register or stack
  pointer, encoded in the "Rd" field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the first source general-purpose register or stack
  pointer, encoded in the "Rn" field.

 <R>
  Encoded in option
  Is a width specifier,

  option <R> 
  00x    W   
  010    W   
  x11    X   
  10x    W   
  110    W   

 <m>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the number [0-30] of the second general-purpose source register or the name
  ZR (31), encoded in the "Rm" field.

 <extend>
  Encoded in option
  For the 32-bit variant: is the extension to be applied to the second source
  operand,

  option <extend> 
  000    UXTB     
  001    UXTH     
  010    LSL|UXTW 
  011    UXTX     
  100    SXTB     
  101    SXTH     
  110    SXTW     
  111    SXTX     

  If "Rd" or "Rn" is '11111' (WSP) and "option" is '010' then LSL is preferred,
  but may be omitted when "imm3" is '000'. In all other cases <extend> is
  required and must be UXTW when "option" is '010'.

 <extend>
  Encoded in option
  For the 64-bit variant: is the extension to be applied to the second source
  operand,

  option <extend> 
  000    UXTB     
  001    UXTH     
  010    UXTW     
  011    LSL|UXTX 
  100    SXTB     
  101    SXTH     
  110    SXTW     
  111    SXTX     

  If "Rd" or "Rn" is '11111' (SP) and "option" is '011' then LSL is preferred,
  but may be omitted when "imm3" is '000'. In all other cases <extend> is
  required and must be UXTX when "option" is '011'.

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm3
  Is the left shift amount to be applied after extension in the range 0 to 4,
  defaulting to 0, encoded in the "imm3" field. It must be absent when <extend>
  is absent, is required when <extend> is LSL, and is optional when <extend> is
  present but not LSL.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

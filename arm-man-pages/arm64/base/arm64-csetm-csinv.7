 Conditional Set Mask

 Conditional Set Mask sets all bits of the destination register to 1 if the
 condition is TRUE, and otherwise sets all bits to 0.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Xd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <cond>
  Encoded in cond
  Is one of the standard conditions, excluding AL and NV, encoded in the "cond"
  field with its least significant bit inverted.



.SS Operation

 The manual of CSINV gives pseudocode for CSETM.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

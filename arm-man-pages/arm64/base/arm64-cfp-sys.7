 Control Flow Prediction Restriction by Context

 Control Flow Prediction Restriction by Context prevents control flow
 predictions that predict execution addresses, based on information gathered
 from earlier execution within a particular execution context, from allowing
 later speculative execution within that context to be observable through side-
 channels.

 For more information, see CFP RCTX, Control Flow Prediction Restriction by
 Context.

 Debug Change PE State to EL1.

 Debug Change PE State to EL1, when executed in Debug state:


 The target exception level of a DCPS1 instruction is:


 When the target Exception level of a DCPS1 instruction is ELx, on executing
 this instruction:

 ELR_ELx becomes unknown.

 ELR_ELx becomes unknown.

 SPSR_ELx becomes unknown.

 SPSR_ELx becomes unknown.

 ESR_ELx becomes unknown.

 ESR_ELx becomes unknown.

 DLR_EL0 and DSPSR_EL0 become unknown.

 DLR_EL0 and DSPSR_EL0 become unknown.

 DLR_EL0 and DSPSR_EL0 become unknown.

 The endianness is set according to SCTLR_ELx. EE.


 This instruction is undefined at EL0 in Non-secure state if EL2 is implemented
 and HCR_EL2.TGE == 1.

 This instruction is always undefined in Non-debug state.

 For more information on the operation of the DCPSn instructions, see DCPS.

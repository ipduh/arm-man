.SS LDSMAX, LDSMAXA, LDSMAXAL, LDSMAXL
 Atomic signed maximum on word or doubleword in memory

 Atomic signed maximum on word or doubleword in memory atomically loads a 32-bit
 word or 64-bit doubleword from memory, compares it against the value held in a
 register, and stores the larger value back to memory, treating the values as
 signed numbers. The value initially loaded from memory is returned in the
 destination register.

 If the destination register is not one of WZR or XZR, LDSMAXA and LDSMAXAL load
 from memory with acquire semantics.

 If the destination register is not one of WZR or XZR, LDSMAXA and LDSMAXAL load
 from memory with acquire semantics.

 If the destination register is not one of WZR or XZR, LDSMAXA and LDSMAXAL load
 from memory with acquire semantics.

 If the destination register is not one of WZR or XZR, LDSMAXA and LDSMAXAL load
 from memory with acquire semantics.

 LDSMAXL and LDSMAXAL store to memory with release semantics.

 LDSMAXL and LDSMAXAL store to memory with release semantics.

 LDSMAX has no memory ordering requirements.


 For more information about memory ordering semantics see Load-Acquire, Store-
 Release.

 For information about memory accesses see Load/Store addressing modes.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Ws>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Wt>
  Encoded in Rt
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register to be loaded, encoded in
  the "Rt" field.

 <Xs>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xt>
  Encoded in Rt
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose register to be loaded, encoded in
  the "Rt" field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.

 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

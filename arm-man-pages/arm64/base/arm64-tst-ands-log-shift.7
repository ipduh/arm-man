 Test (shifted register)

 Test (shifted register) performs a bitwise AND operation on a register value
 and an optionally-shifted register value. It updates the condition flags based
 on the result, and discards the result.

 <Wn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 32-bit name of the first general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rn" field.

 <Wm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 32-bit name of the second general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rm" field.

 <Xn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the first general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rn" field.

 <Xm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 64-bit name of the second general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rm" field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in shift
  Is the optional shift to be applied to the final source, defaulting to LSL and

  shift <shift> 
  00    LSL     
  01    LSR     
  10    ASR

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm6
  For the 32-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 31, defaulting
  to 0 and encoded in the "imm6" field.

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm6
  For the 64-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 63, defaulting
  to 0 and encoded in the "imm6" field,



.SS Operation

 The manual of ANDS gives pseudocode for TST.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

.SS STSMAXB, STSMAXLB
 STSMAXLB is an alias of LDSMAXLB

 Atomic signed maximum on byte in memory, without return

 Atomic signed maximum on byte in memory, without return, atomically loads an
 8-bit byte from memory, compares it against the value held in a register, and
 stores the larger value back to memory, treating the values as signed numbers.

 STSMAXB has no memory ordering semantics.

 STSMAXLB stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.

 STSMAXLB stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Ws>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of LDSMAXLB gives pseudocode for STSMAXLB.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

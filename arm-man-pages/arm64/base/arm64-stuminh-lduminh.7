 STUMINLH is an alias of LDUMINLH

 Atomic unsigned minimum on halfword in memory, without return

 Atomic unsigned minimum on halfword in memory, without return, atomically loads
 a 16-bit halfword from memory, compares it against the value held in a
 register, and stores the smaller value back to memory, treating the values as
 unsigned numbers.

 STUMINH has no memory ordering semantics.

 STUMINLH stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.

 STUMINLH stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Ws>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of LDUMINLH gives pseudocode for STUMINLH.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

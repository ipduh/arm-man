.SS ADRP
 Form PC-relative address to 4KB page

 Form PC-relative address to 4KB page adds an immediate value that is shifted
 left by 12 bits, to the PC value to form a PC-relative address, with the bottom
 12 bits masked out, and writes the result to the destination register.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Xd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <label>
  Encoded in immhi:immlo
  Is the program label whose 4KB page address is to be calculated. Its offset
  from the page address of this instruction, in the range +/-4GB, is encoded as
  "immhi:immlo" times 4096.



.SS Operation

 bits(64) base = PC[];
 
 if page then
     base<11:0> = Zeros(12);
 
 X[d] = base + imm;

.SS STADD, STADDL
 STADDL is an alias of LDADDL

 Atomic add on word or doubleword in memory, without return

 Atomic add on word or doubleword in memory, without return, atomically loads a
 32-bit word or 64-bit doubleword from memory, adds the value held in a register
 to it, and stores the result back to memory.

 STADD has no memory ordering semantics.

 STADDL stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.

 STADDL stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.


 For information about memory accesses see Load/Store addressing modes.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Ws>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xs>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of LDADDL gives pseudocode for STADDL.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

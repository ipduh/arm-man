 context synchronization event. For more information, see Instruction
 Synchronization Barrier (ISB).

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <option>
  Specifies an optional limitation on the barrier operation. Values are:
  SYFull system barrier operation, encoded as CRm = 0b1111. Can be omitted.
  All other encodings of CRm are reserved. The corresponding instructions
  execute as full system barrier operations, but must not be relied upon by
  software.

 <imm>
  Encoded in CRm
  Is an optional 4-bit unsigned immediate, in the range 0 to 15, defaulting to
  15 and encoded in the "CRm" field.

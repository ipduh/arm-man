.SS CMP (immediate)
 CMP is an alias of SUBS

 Compare (immediate)

 Compare (immediate) subtracts an optionally-shifted immediate value from a
 register value. It updates the condition flags based on the result, and
 discards the result.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wn|WSP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 32-bit name of the source general-purpose register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the source general-purpose register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.

 <imm>
  Encoded in imm12
  Is an unsigned immediate, in the range 0 to 4095, encoded in the "imm12"
  field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in sh
  Is the optional left shift to apply to the immediate, defaulting to LSL #0 and

  sh <shift> 
  0  LSL #0  
  1  LSL #12 



.SS Operation

 The manual of SUBS gives pseudocode for CMP.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

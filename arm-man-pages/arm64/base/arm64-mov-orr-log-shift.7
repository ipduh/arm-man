.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Wm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field.

 <Xd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Xm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of ORR gives pseudocode for MOV.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

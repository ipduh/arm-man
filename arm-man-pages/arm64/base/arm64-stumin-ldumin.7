.SS STUMIN, STUMINL
 STUMINL is an alias of LDUMINL

 Atomic unsigned minimum on word or doubleword in memory, without return

 Atomic unsigned minimum on word or doubleword in memory, without return,
 atomically loads a 32-bit word or 64-bit doubleword from memory, compares it
 against the value held in a register, and stores the smaller value back to
 memory, treating the values as unsigned numbers.

 STUMIN has no memory ordering semantics.

 STUMINL stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.

 STUMINL stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Ws>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xs>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of LDUMINL gives pseudocode for STUMINL.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

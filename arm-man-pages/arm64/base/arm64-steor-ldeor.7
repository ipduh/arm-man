.SS STEOR, STEORL
 STEORL is an alias of LDEORL

 Atomic exclusive OR on word or doubleword in memory, without return

 Atomic exclusive OR on word or doubleword in memory, without return, atomically
 loads a 32-bit word or 64-bit doubleword from memory, performs an exclusive OR
 with the value held in a register on it, and stores the result back to memory.

 STEOR has no memory ordering semantics.

 STEORL stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.

 STEORL stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.


 For information about memory accesses see Load/Store addressing modes.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Ws>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xs>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of LDEORL gives pseudocode for STEORL.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

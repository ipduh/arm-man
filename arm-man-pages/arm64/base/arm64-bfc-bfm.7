 Bitfield Clear

 Bitfield Clear sets a bitfield of <width> bits at bit position <lsb> of the
 destination register to zero, leaving the other destination bits unchanged.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Xd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <lsb>
  For the 32-bit variant: is the bit number of the lsb of the destination
  bitfield, in the range 0 to 31.

 <lsb>
  For the 64-bit variant: is the bit number of the lsb of the destination
  bitfield, in the range 0 to 63.

 <width>
  For the 32-bit variant: is the width of the bitfield, in the range 1 to
  32-<lsb>.

 <width>
  For the 64-bit variant: is the width of the bitfield, in the range 1 to
  64-<lsb>.

 The manual of BFM gives pseudocode for BFC.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

 Branch

 Branch causes an unconditional branch to a label at a PC-relative offset, with
 a hint that this is not a subroutine call or return.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <label>
  Encoded in imm26
  Is the program label to be unconditionally branched to. Its offset from the
  address of this instruction, in the range +/-128MB, is encoded as "imm26"
  times 4.



.SS Operation

 if branch_type == BranchType_DIRCALL then X[30] = PC[] + 4;
 
 BranchTo(PC[] + offset, branch_type);

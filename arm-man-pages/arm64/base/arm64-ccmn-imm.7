 Conditional Compare Negative (immediate)

 Conditional Compare Negative (immediate) sets the value of the condition flags
 to the result of the comparison of a register value and a negated immediate
 value if the condition is TRUE, and an immediate value otherwise.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 32-bit name of the first general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rn" field.

 <Xn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the first general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rn" field.

 <imm>
  Encoded in imm5
  Is a five bit unsigned (positive) immediate encoded in the "imm5" field.

 <nzcv>
  Encoded in nzcv
  Is the flag bit specifier, an immediate in the range 0 to 15, giving the
  alternative state for the 4-bit NZCV condition flags, encoded in the "nzcv"
  field.

 <cond>
  Encoded in cond
  Is one of the standard conditions, encoded in the "cond" field in the standard
  way.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

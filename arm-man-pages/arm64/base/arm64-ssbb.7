 Speculative Store Bypass Barrier

 Speculative Store Bypass Barrier is a memory barrier which prevents speculative
 loads from bypassing earlier stores to the same virtual address under certain
 conditions.

 The semantics of the Speculative Store Bypass Barrier are:

 When a load to a location appears in program order after the SSBB, then the
 load does not speculatively read an entry earlier in the coherence order for
 that location than the entry generated by the latest store satisfying all of
 the following conditions:

 When a load to a location appears in program order before the SSBB, then the
 load does not speculatively read data from any store satisfying all of the
 following conditions:

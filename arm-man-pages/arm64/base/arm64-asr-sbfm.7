 Arithmetic Shift Right (immediate)

 Arithmetic Shift Right (immediate) shifts a register value right by an
 immediate number of bits, shifting in copies of the sign bit in the upper bits
 and zeros in the lower bits, and writes the result to the destination register.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Wn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rn"
  field.

 <Xd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Xn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rn"
  field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in immr
  For the 32-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 31, encoded in
  the "immr" field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in immr
  For the 64-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 63, encoded in
  the "immr" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of SBFM gives pseudocode for ASR.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

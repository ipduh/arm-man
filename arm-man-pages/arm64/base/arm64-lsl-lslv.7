 Logical Shift Left (register)

 Logical Shift Left (register) shifts a register value left by a variable number
 of bits, shifting in zeros, and writes the result to the destination register.
 The remainder obtained by dividing the second source register by the data size
 defines the number of bits by which the first source register is left-shifted.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Wn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 32-bit name of the first general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rn" field.

 <Wm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 32-bit name of the second general-purpose source register holding a
  shift amount from 0 to 31 in its bottom 5 bits, encoded in the "Rm" field.

 <Xd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Xn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the first general-purpose source register, encoded in
  the "Rn" field.

 <Xm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 64-bit name of the second general-purpose source register holding a
  shift amount from 0 to 63 in its bottom 6 bits, encoded in the "Rm" field.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

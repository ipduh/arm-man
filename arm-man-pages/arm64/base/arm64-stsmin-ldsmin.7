.SS STSMIN, STSMINL
 STSMINL is an alias of LDSMINL

 Atomic signed minimum on word or doubleword in memory, without return

 Atomic signed minimum on word or doubleword in memory, without return,
 atomically loads a 32-bit word or 64-bit doubleword from memory, compares it
 against the value held in a register, and stores the smaller value back to
 memory, treating the values as signed numbers.

 STSMIN has no memory ordering semantics.

 STSMINL stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,
 Store-Release.

 STSMINL stores to memory with release semantics, as described in Load-Acquire,

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Ws>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xs>
  Encoded in Rs
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the data value to
  be operated on with the contents of the memory location, encoded in the "Rs"
  field.

 <Xn|SP>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer,
  encoded in the "Rn" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of LDSMINL gives pseudocode for STSMINL.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1, the timing of this instruction is insensitive to the value of the data being loaded or stored.

 Logical Shift Right (immediate)

 Logical Shift Right (immediate) shifts a register value right by an immediate
 number of bits, shifting in zeros, and writes the result to the destination
 register.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Wn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rn"
  field.

 <Xd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Xn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rn"
  field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in immr
  For the 32-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 31, encoded in
  the "immr" field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in immr
  For the 64-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 63, encoded in
  the "immr" field.



.SS Operation

 The manual of UBFM gives pseudocode for LSR.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

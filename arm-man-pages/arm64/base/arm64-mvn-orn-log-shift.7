.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Wd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Wm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 32-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field.

 <Xd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose destination register, encoded in the
  "Rd" field.

 <Xm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose source register, encoded in the "Rm"
  field.

 <shift>
  Encoded in shift
  Is the optional shift to be applied to the final source, defaulting to LSL and

  shift <shift> 
  00    LSL     
  01    LSR     
  10    ASR     
  11    ROR     

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm6
  For the 32-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 31, defaulting
  to 0 and encoded in the "imm6" field.

 <amount>
  Encoded in imm6
  For the 64-bit variant: is the shift amount, in the range 0 to 63, defaulting
  to 0 and encoded in the "imm6" field,



.SS Operation

 The manual of ORN gives pseudocode for MVN.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

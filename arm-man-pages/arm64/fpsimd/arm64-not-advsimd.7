.SS NOT
 Bitwise NOT (vector)

 Bitwise NOT (vector). This instruction reads each vector element from the
 source SIMD&FP register, places the inverse of each value into a vector, and
 writes the vector to the destination SIMD&FP register.

 Depending on the settings in the CPACR_EL1, CPTR_EL2, and CPTR_EL3 registers,
 and the current Security state and Exception level, an attempt to execute the
 instruction might be trapped.

.SS Operation

 CheckFPAdvSIMDEnabled64();
 bits(datasize) operand = V[n];
 bits(datasize) result;
 bits(esize) element;
 
 for e = 0 to elements-1
     element = Elem[operand, e, esize];
     Elem[result, e, esize] = NOT(element);
 
 V[d] = result;


.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

.SS FDIV (scalar)
 Floating-point Divide (scalar)

 Floating-point Divide (scalar). This instruction divides the floating-point
 value of the first source SIMD&FP register by the floating-point value of the
 second source SIMD&FP register, and writes the result to the destination
 SIMD&FP register.

 This instruction can generate a floating-point exception. Depending on the
 settings in FPCR, the exception results in either a flag being set in FPSR, or
 a synchronous exception being generated. For more information, see Floating-
 point exception traps.

 Depending on the settings in the CPACR_EL1, CPTR_EL2, and CPTR_EL3 registers,
 and the current Security state and Exception level, an attempt to execute the
 instruction might be trapped.

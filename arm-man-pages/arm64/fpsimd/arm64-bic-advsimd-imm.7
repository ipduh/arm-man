.SS BIC (vector, immediate)
 Bitwise bit Clear (vector, immediate)

 Bitwise bit Clear (vector, immediate). This instruction reads each vector
 element from the destination SIMD&FP register, performs a bitwise AND between
 each result and the complement of an immediate constant, places the result into
 a vector, and writes the vector to the destination SIMD&FP register.

 Depending on the settings in the CPACR_EL1, CPTR_EL2, and CPTR_EL3 registers,
 and the current Security state and Exception level, an attempt to execute the
 instruction might be trapped.

 Transpose vectors (secondary)

 Transpose vectors (secondary). This instruction reads corresponding odd-
 numbered vector elements from the two source SIMD&FP registers, places each
 result into consecutive elements of a vector, and writes the vector to the
 destination SIMD&FP register. Vector elements from the first source register
 are placed into even-numbered elements of the destination vector, starting at
 zero, while vector elements from the second source register are placed into
 odd-numbered elements of the destination vector.



 Depending on the settings in the CPACR_EL1, CPTR_EL2, and CPTR_EL3 registers,
 and the current Security state and Exception level, an attempt to execute the
 instruction might be trapped.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

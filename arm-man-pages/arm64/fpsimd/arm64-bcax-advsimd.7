.SS BCAX
 Bit Clear and XOR

 Bit Clear and Exclusive OR performs a bitwise AND of the 128-bit vector in a
 source SIMD&FP register and the complement of the vector in another source
 SIMD&FP register, then performs a bitwise exclusive OR of the resulting vector
 and the vector in a third source SIMD&FP register, and writes the result to the
 destination SIMD&FP register.

 This instruction is implemented only when ARMv8.2-SHA is implemented.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

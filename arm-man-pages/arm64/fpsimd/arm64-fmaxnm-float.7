.SS FMAXNM (scalar)
 Floating-point Maximum Number (scalar)

 Floating-point Maximum Number (scalar). This instruction compares the first and
 second source SIMD&FP register values, and writes the larger of the two
 floating-point values to the destination SIMD&FP register.

 NaNs are handled according to the IEEE 754-2008 standard. If one vector element
 is numeric and the other is a quiet NaN, the result that is placed in the
 vector is the numerical value, otherwise the result is identical to FMAX
 (scalar).

 This instruction can generate a floating-point exception. Depending on the
 settings in FPCR, the exception results in either a flag being set in FPSR, or
 a synchronous exception being generated. For more information, see Floating-
 point exception traps.

 Depending on the settings in the CPACR_EL1, CPTR_EL2, and CPTR_EL3 registers,
 and the current Security state and Exception level, an attempt to execute the
 instruction might be trapped.

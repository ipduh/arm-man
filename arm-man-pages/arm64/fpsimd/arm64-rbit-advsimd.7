.SS RBIT (vector)
 Reverse Bit order (vector)

 Reverse Bit order (vector). This instruction reads each vector element from the
 source SIMD&FP register, reverses the bits of the element, places the results
 into a vector, and writes the vector to the destination SIMD&FP register.

 Depending on the settings in the CPACR_EL1, CPTR_EL2, and CPTR_EL3 registers,
 and the current Security state and Exception level, an attempt to execute the
 instruction might be trapped.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

.SS EOR3
 Three-way Exclusive OR

 Three-way Exclusive OR performs a three-way exclusive OR of the values in the
 three source SIMD&FP registers, and writes the result to the destination
 SIMD&FP register.

 This instruction is implemented only when ARMv8.2-SHA is implemented.

.SS Assembler Symbols

 <Vd>
  Encoded in Rd
  Is the name of the SIMD&FP destination register, encoded in the "Rd" field.

 <Vn>
  Encoded in Rn
  Is the name of the first SIMD&FP source register, encoded in the "Rn" field.

 <Vm>
  Encoded in Rm
  Is the name of the second SIMD&FP source register, encoded in the "Rm" field.

 <Va>
  Encoded in Ra
  Is the name of the third SIMD&FP source register, encoded in the "Ra" field.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

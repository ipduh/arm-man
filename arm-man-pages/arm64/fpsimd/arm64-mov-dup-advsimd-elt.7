.SS MOV (scalar)
 MOV is an alias of DUP

 Move vector element to scalar

 Move vector element to scalar. This instruction duplicates the specified vector
 element in the SIMD&FP source register into a scalar, and writes the result to
 the SIMD&FP destination register.

 Depending on the settings in the CPACR_EL1, CPTR_EL2, and CPTR_EL3 registers,
 and the current Security state and Exception level, an attempt to execute the
 instruction might be trapped.

.SS Operation

 The manual of DUP gives pseudocode for MOV.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.

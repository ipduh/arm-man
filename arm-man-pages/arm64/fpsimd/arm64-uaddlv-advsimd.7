.SS UADDLV
 Unsigned sum Long across Vector

 Unsigned sum Long across Vector. This instruction adds every vector element in
 the source SIMD&FP register together, and writes the scalar result to the
 destination SIMD&FP register. The destination scalar is twice as long as the
 source vector elements. All the values in this instruction are unsigned integer
 values.

 Depending on the settings in the CPACR_EL1, CPTR_EL2, and CPTR_EL3 registers,
 and the current Security state and Exception level, an attempt to execute the
 instruction might be trapped.

.SS Operational Notes

 
 If PSTATE.DIT is 1: 
 
 The execution time of this instruction is independent of: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
 The response of this instruction to asynchronous exceptions does not vary based on: 
 The values of the data supplied in any of its registers.
 The values of the NZCV flags.
